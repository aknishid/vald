# Issue

## Bug Report

A bug is a demonstrable problem that produces an incorrect result or behaves in unintended ways.

Bug reports are helpful for developers who maintain the Vald project.
A good bug report should not leave others needing to constantly ask you for more information.
Please try to write as detailed as possible in your bug report.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Vald are you using (vald docker image version)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

Please submit the bug report [here](https://github.com/vdaas/vald/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Fbug%2C+priority%2Fmedium%2C+team%2Fcore&template=bug_report.md&title=)

## Proposal

The Vald is being developed based on the design-driven process.

The significant change to the library or the architecture should be discussed first.

We may ask for detailed documentation before your proposal is accepted.

Your proposal will be reviewed, discussed, and decided whether it is accepted or declined.

Please submit the proposal [here](https://github.com/vdaas/vald/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Ffeature%2C+priority%2Flow%2C+team%2Fcore&template=feature_request.md&title=)

## Feature Request

Feature request is welcome.

Before opening an issue, please make sure your idea fits the project.

You can request the feature and convince the project maintainers to accept your feature request.

Please provide the problem and solution associated with the feature request in as much detail as possible.

NOTE: If youâ€™d like to contribute to the new feature which may affect the current Vald architecture or design, you should discuss it with the Vald team first.

Please submit the feature request [here](https://github.com/vdaas/vald/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Ffeature%2C+priority%2Flow%2C+team%2Fcore&template=feature_request.md&title=)

## Security Issue Report

The Vald team and community have a serious concern about security issues.

Sensitive security-related issues should be reported to the security channel in [Vald Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/vald-community/shared_invite/zt-db2ky9o4-R_9p2sVp8xRwztVa8gfnPA).

We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings.

If the security issue is caused by a third-party module, we will contact the module owner and ask for a fix.

We will consider using another third-party module if the vulnerable module is not actively maintained anymore.

Please submit the security issue report [here](https://github.com/vdaas/vald/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Fsecurity%2C+priority%2Fmedium%2C+team%2Fcore%2C+team%2Fsre&template=security_issue_report.md&title=)
